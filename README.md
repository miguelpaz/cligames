# Command Line Game for Journalists
Help Heredia go through labyrinths filled with traps, half truths and other dangerous surprises to get in contact with his sources and access very relevant documents that could change History and Journalism. 

### Based on: 
- Behind the scenes of notorious high impact stories of whistleblowers information (Deep Throat, [Daniel Ellsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg), [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), [John Doe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe_Panama_Papers%27_whistleblower)
- Other big stories? (tbd)

### Goal
To teach journalism students and professional journalists how to use Terminal and Command Line in a fun way they can relate to.

### But they say “Nobody takes Command, son.”
We will see about that.
